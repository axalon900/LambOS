Lamb Operating System

Overview

LambOS is a hobby operating system with three intentions:
* Fulfill a long-standing goal to write an operating system
* Gain experience in low-level software engineering and learn more about computer architecture
* Explore ideas about how an operating system could function

Name

An allegory to the humble OS developer, naive and optimistic before hitting the confidence buzzsaw that is bare metal programming.

Or maybe it's just a pun on my old boss's NetID.
