Mongoose Research Operating System
========

Overview
--------
Mongoose is a hobby operating system with three intentions:
* Fulfill a long-standing goal to write an operating system
* Gain experience in low-level software engineering and learn more about computer architecture
* Explore ideas about how an operating system could function

I had this idea of an object-based filesystem, where files were objects (in the OO sense) and could be written and read as such. Rather than the idea of a standard DBFS where the database entries are a collection of file metadata attributes and the actual data is stored as a binary blob in a fixed schema, this would be schemaless. In other words, something like MongoDB as a filesystem. A few permutations later led me to MongoOS, which, if you add an E to the end, makes Mongoose.

The name may be already taken by an object modeling tool for MongoDB written in Javascript for his overrated majesty, Node.js, but fuck 'em.
